I've been dedicated to developing various types of video games and apps for years now, with a fair level of consistency since 2019. As for video games, I started with Unity and later switched to Godot for a myriad of reasons that I’ll explain someday. For software development, I mainly use Python. You can find some updates and tutorials on my YouTube page and X account: https://www.youtube.com/@naurk; https://x.com/naurk_dev.

I’ve never published anything complete, as it has always been a learning journey where I would develop something and then lose confidence in the product. My main project in this field is a 3D Soulslike video game, with updates regularly posted on the YouTube channel. Soon, I’ll be releasing a major update on the game: a playable demo is expected within a year, and the full game release within three years. I work alone in my free time, so if you’d like to help, let me know! :)
